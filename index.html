<h1>Ruby </h1>


<p>
    <b>Ruby</b> is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. <br>
    It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity.
    <br> In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. <br> It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
    Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation.<br>
    It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. <br>
    According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, Java, and Lisp.
</p>


<h2>
  <ins>Istorija</ins>
</h2>

<p>Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:</p>
<blockquote>I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. <br>
    <var>I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has).</var><br>
    The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language – OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. <br>
    As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it.
    <br><cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)</cite></blockquote>
<p>
    The name "<sub>Ruby</sub>" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.
    <br>
    <sup>Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.</sup>
    <br>
    <dfn>Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" –it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.</dfn>

<h2>
    Značaj
</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails, Ruby’s web framework, is one of the most popular web development frameworks in any language.
    <br>
    Although Ruby is probably most famous for its use in web development, it has many other uses, too.
    <br>
    Some of these include automation, command-line tools, static site generation, DevOps, web scraping, and data processing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Perhaps most importantly, Ruby is a highly versatile and portable language. It can be used just as easily on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even UNIX and DOS.
    <br>
    No matter what programming job you want to get done, there’s a gold chance you can do it in Ruby.
</p>

<strong>In this example we want to find out if given an array of unique numbers, there is a combination of two numbers which adds up to a target number.</strong>
<code>
<pre> def sum_eq_n?(arr, n)
         return true if arr.empty? && n == 0
         arr.product(arr).reject { |a,b| a == b }.any? { |a,b| a + b == n }
      end
</pre>
</code>

This is interesting because I’m using the <code>product</code> method here.
<br>When you use this method is like having a loop inside a loop that combines all values in array A with all values in array B.

<i>Write a program to create a class with data members and initialize using initialize() method.</i>
Solution:<br>
In this program, we will create a class Student that contains 3 data members id, name, and fee.
<br>Then we will define the initialize() method to initialize the data members and we will also create a PrintStudentInfo() method to print student information.
<pre><small># Ruby program to create a class with data members
# and initialize using initialize() method</small>

class Student
    def initialize(id, name, fee)
        @id   = id;
        @name = name;
        @fee  = fee;
    end

    def PrintStudentInfo()
        print "Student Id:   ",@id,"\n";
        print "Student Name: ",@name,"\n";
        print "Student Fee:  ",@fee,"\n";
    end
end

obj = Student.new(101,"Rahul", 5000);

obj.PrintStudentInfo();
</pre>
<mark>Output:</mark>
<pre>
   Student Id:   101
Student Name: Rahul
Student Fee:  5000

    <del> Greska</del>
</pre>
Explanation:
<p><br>In the above program, we created a class called Student. The Student class contains data member's id, name, and fee.
    <br>Then we defined the initialize() method to initialize the data members and we also created a PrintStudentInfo() method to print student information.
    <br>Then we created the object of the class and initialized the data members and called PrintStudentInfo() method to print student information.

<samp>RubyGems is Ruby's package manager. A Ruby package is called a "gem" and can be installed via the command line. <br>

    Most gems are libraries, though a few exist that are applications, such as IDEs. There are over 100,000 Ruby gems hosted on RubyGems.org.
</samp>
<br>
<br>
<abbr>Many new and existing Ruby libraries are hosted on GitHub, a service that offers version control repository hosting for Git.
<br>
    The Ruby Application Archive, which hosted applications, documentation, and libraries for Ruby programming, was maintained until 2013, when its function was transferred to RubyGems.
